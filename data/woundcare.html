<h1>Remove the old dressing</h1>

<ul>
<li>Wash your hands with soap and warm water or an 
alcohol-based hand rub.</li>
<li>Put on the gloves.</li>
<li>Slowly lift the corners or edges of the dressing or tape. 
If it sticks to the skin, dab the edges with an adhesive 
remover, a moistened gauze pad, or a moistened 
paper towel.</li>
<li>Hold down the skin surrounding the bandaged area. 
Gently and slowly remove the tape or dressing. Lift the 
tape across the skin rather pulling away from the skin. </li>
<li>Lift the edges of the dressing toward the center of the 
wound, then gently lift it from the wound.</li>
<li>If the dressing sticks to the wound, soak it with saline 
solution to help loosen it. </li>
<li>Carefully discard the old dressing into a plastic trash 
bag and tie it closed. Put that bag into a second plastic 
bag and throw it away.</li>
<li>Remove the gloves and wash your hands again.</li>
</ul>
